                    Given the unique nature of our products and services, especially the digital format and sensitivity of the information provided, Congruence Market Insights does not accept returns once products have been delivered. The inherent nature of digital data makes returns impractical. Customers are urged to carefully consider their purchase decisions, as completed transactions are irreversible.

                    Due to the confidential and invaluable nature of the data within our reports, refunds cannot be processed after the report has been dispatched. Nevertheless, our commitment to customer satisfaction means we are open to addressing any concerns or discrepancies. If the report contains missing or incomplete data, our team is ready to customize the report to meet your specific requirements.
